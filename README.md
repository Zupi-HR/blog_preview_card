## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned more about responsive design, specifically how to combine width and max-width. Previously, I had an issue where the card element would take up the full viewport width on smaller screens. By setting width: 90%, I was able to create the necessary space around the element. I also made sure to primarily use rem units instead of px to ensure the design remains scalable if a user changes their browser's default font size.

```css
.blog-card {
  width: 90%;
  max-width: 24rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my skills and knowledge in creating responsive designs and choosing the right units for elements.
